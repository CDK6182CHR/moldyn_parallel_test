# Bessa's Moldyn, a C++ simulation program - Version 1.0 06/06/2019
A c++ code of Molecular Dynamics of point particles for general purpose

The source code is released under the MIT License.

Developer: Vagner H. L. Bessa (bessavagner@gmail.com)

## GENERAL USAGE NOTES

- This is a free C++ library for general purporse.
- It was written and only tested in Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) 64bits system.
- The full original library can be found at:
    https://github.com/bessavagner/moldyn

## BASIC USER'S GUIED

- The main purpose of this library is to simulate a system of interacting particles via [Lennard-Jones potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential). The system is enclosed in a elastic wall recipient (refletions on the wall are perfectly elastic), therefore the mechanical energy is constant ([microcanonical ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcanonical_ensemble)), while the temperature varies and oscilates between an average value.
